# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add optional Backblaze B2 storage support for generated media and reference assets.

### Changed

- Standardize Runway BYOK form rendering around Semantic Lady schema fields.
- Separate image and video input handling for Runway models while keeping shared UI media/file wording generic.
- Render Runway duration as a bounded select control and use local field descriptions for Studio form help text.
- Order Studio model dropdowns by image models first, then video models, with alphabetical sorting inside each group.
- Order storage providers alphabetically (`aws-s3`, `backblaze-b2`, `cloudflare-r2`, `supabase-storage`, `vercel-blob`) wherever they are enumerated across configuration, adapters, and dashboards.

### Fixed

- Accept standard Backblaze `B2_KEY_ID`, `B2_APP_KEY`, and `B2_BUCKET_NAME` env aliases and refresh stale Backblaze Native API account tokens before falling back to Supabase Storage.
- Read the Backblaze B2 endpoints from the v3 `b2_authorize_account` response (`apiInfo.storageApi`) so bucket lookups and uploads no longer fail with an undefined URL and silently fall back to Supabase Storage.
- Display generated media and reference assets stored in a private Backblaze B2 bucket by adding the Backblaze download host to the image and media Content-Security-Policy allowlists.
- Ignore stale form values that are outside the active Runway model schema.
- Omit empty video input values from BYOK submissions so image-only Runway model paths do not receive unsupported schema fields.
- Preserve durable input reference assets after terminal generation states so the References dashboard keeps displaying uploaded and URL-based inputs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27 - INITIAL RELEASED

- Implement Runway models.
