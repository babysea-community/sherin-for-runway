# Sherin Agent Guide

Sherin is a standalone BabySea OSS starter for a self-hosted private generative media workspace. It is owner-only, supports own-key inference, own-domain deployment, and user-controlled storage, and keeps provider credentials server-side.

## Scope

Use this guide for changes inside the Sherin starter, especially owner auth, inference providers, storage providers, dashboard workflows, public homepage/gallery surfaces, deploy configuration, and starter documentation.

## Working Rules

- State assumptions before changing owner auth, inference providers, storage providers, generation processing, or deployment behavior.
- Keep changes surgical. Do not refactor dashboard flows, storage adapters, or database contracts unless the requested behavior requires it.
- Prefer the smallest implementation that preserves the owner-only workspace boundary.
- Update only docs, env examples, doctor checks, tests, or changelog entries that are directly affected by the change.
- Verify with the narrowest useful command first, then broaden when shared behavior is touched.

## Conventions

- Sherin is owner-only. The owner allowlist configured in `.env.example` gates dashboard access after Supabase Google OAuth.
- `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=runway` uses direct Runway execution; `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=babysea` uses the BabySea SDK.
- Keep every secret described in `.env.example` server-side unless the template explicitly marks it as public.
- Storage provider choices are `supabase-storage`, `aws-s3`, `cloudflare-r2`, and `vercel-blob`; Supabase Storage is the default and fallback path.
- Use `ProtectedImage` for public homepage, dashboard screenshot, icon, and gallery image rendering. Do not reintroduce `next/image` for those assets unless explicitly requested.
- On the public homepage, prefer solid paint for compact mobile cards, icon buttons, and link surfaces. Avoid stacking translucent backgrounds, rings, shadows, backdrop blur, transforms, or transitions on Android-sensitive surfaces.
- Generation records, prompts, statuses, provider metadata, storage URLs, references, and profile state persist in Supabase behind RLS.
- `/api/generations/process` can be called by owner-triggered dashboard flows or cron with the configured worker bearer secret from `.env.example`.
- `pnpm run doctor` must validate wiring without printing secrets.

## Verification

- `pnpm run doctor`
- `pnpm format`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test:run`
- `pnpm build`
